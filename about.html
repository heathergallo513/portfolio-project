              Aside from being part of the entire Myspace generation who was
              fluent in marquee text and embedding strictly Sepia toned images
              through Photobucket, I'm a complete newcomer to coding in the
              professional sense. I've worked within a few different industries,
              but there was always a need to work creatively and problem-solve
              that hadn't been met. Despite feelings of imdimidation and

              and the amazing support from the tech profesionals on our Slack
              channels has affirmed by decision for a new career path. It's by
              far one of the hardest challenges I've had to push through, but
              the outcome has been worth it every time. I can't wait to see how
              my work continues to evolve as shown in just the first 3 projects!
