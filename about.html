    <h2>About My Work</h2>
    <p>
      Besides growing up in the Myspace generation (have I aged myself?), I'm a
      complete newcomer to coding in the professional sense. I've worked hard in
      many industries, but there has always been a need to work creatively and
      problem solve that hasn't been met. Despite feeling the intimitation, as
      well as, quite honestly, imposter syndrome, going through the courses led
      by Matt Delac and the amazing support from the tech profesionals on our
      Slack channels has affirmed by decision for a new career path. It's by far
      one of the hardest challenges I've had to push through, but the outcome
      has been worth it every time. I can't wait to see how my work continues to
      evolve!
